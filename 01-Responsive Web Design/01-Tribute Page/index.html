              <span class="item-heading">First Years&colon;</span> Born in the
              German city of Frankfurt am Main in 1929. It was the period in
              which Adolf Hitler and his party were gaining more and more
              supporters. Hitler hated the Jews and blamed them for the problems
              in the country. The hatred of Jews and the poor economic situation
              made Anne's parents, decide to move to Amsterdam.

              >
              1 September 1939, when Anne was 10 years old, Nazi Germany invaded
              Poland and Second World War began. 10 May 1940, the Nazis also
              invaded the Netherlands. Five days later, the Dutch army
              surrendered. The Nazis introduced more and more laws and
              regulations that made the lives of Jews more difficult. Anne's
              father lost his company, since Jews were no longer allowed to run
              their own businesses. All Jewish children, including Anne, had to
              go to separate Jewish schools.

              >
              Margot, Anne's older sister, received a call-up to report for a
              so-called ‘labour camp’ in Nazi Germany on 5 July 1942, her
              parents were suspicious. They did not believe the call-up was
              about work and decided to go into hiding the next day in order to
              escape persecution. The hiding place was cramped. Anne had to keep
              very quiet and was often afraid.

              <span class="item-heading">Anne's Diary&colon;</span> On her
              thirteenth birthday, just before they went into hiding, Anne was
              presented with a diary. During the two years in hiding, Anne wrote
              about events in the Secret Annex, but also about her feelings and
              thoughts. Writing helped her pass the time. Her diary was later
              published titled "The Diary of a Young Girl".

              On 4 August 1944, she and the other people in hiding were
              discovered and arrested by police officers. Despite the raid, part
              of Anne’s writing was preserved.

              the offices of the Sicherheitsdienst (the German security police),
              a prison in Amsterdam, and the Westerbork transit camp, the people
              from the Secret Annex were put on transport to the
              Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration and extermination camp. Anne,
              Margot and their mother were sent to the labour camp for women.
              Otto( Anne's father ) ended up in a camp for men.

              In early November 1944, Anne was put on transport again. She was
              deported to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp with Margot.
              Their parents stayed behind in Auschwitz. The conditions in
              Bergen-Belsen were horrible. There was a lack of food, it was
              cold, wet and there were contagious diseases. Anne and Margot
              contracted typhus. In February 1945 they both died owing to its
              effects, Margot first, Anne shortly afterwards.

              People all over the world were introduced to Anne's story and in
              1960 the hiding place became a museum: the Anne Frank House.
